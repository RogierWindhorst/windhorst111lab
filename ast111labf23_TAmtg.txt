Dear AST 111 Lab TAs:

Welcome to the in-person AST 111 Labs for fall 2023. I have begun to
make a website:

http://windhorst111lab.asu.edu/

Many items are still place holders from 2021, so please ignore those for now.

By replying ONLY to me, please tell ASAP me the following:

1) Weekly TA-meetings: What 1-1.5 hr slot you can meet on Mondays
between noon-5 pm?  Please be flexible.
[If we cannot find a mtg time on Monday, what times on Tuesday
afternoon could you meet instead?]

Our FIRST TA mtg will be Mo Aug. 14 and then every week until we get
to cruising altitude, after which we will have fewer TA mtgs. We hold
these TA mtgs in conjunction with Prof. Karen Knierman and some of her
SESE TAs.

2) Contacts page: Your preferred Email address, your 1-hr/week office
hour time slot, and your Zoom link if you want to hold your office
hour by Zoom.

3) Schedule page: Which evenings of the week and time slots do you
prefer to teach your sections, given the Email Becky sent you with the
number of section you are asked to teach. (We are aware that some of
you are slated for only 25% (10 hrs/week) as TA for AST 111 given
other TA duties).

It would be most helpful to get your responses soon. I will be on the
road this coming week, but hope to make a provisional schedule based
on your responses, taking into account as much as possible everyone's
preferences. I always try very hard to make sure that no students work
more than 20 hrs/wk on their TA job (or less if you are scheduled for
part time TA work). The earlier I get your answers, the better I can
accommodate everyone.

Looking fwd to see you all Monday Aug. 14 (or Tuesday Aug. 15 if
Monday doesn't work).

You can always call my cell if you want to discuss some of this.

Thank you all!

Rogier
