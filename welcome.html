There are several <b>requirements</b> for this class: you need to make sure you
have web access - the University has provided ample access to computers across 
campus and throughout the residence halls to print your Labs.  Second, you need
to check your ASU email address regularly (daily), since this is the primary
mechanism that your TA will use to contact you. (Canvas cannot send Emails to
non-ASU Email addresses). If you have a problem with these policies, you need
to see the Instructor for the class: Prof. Rogier Windhorst (see Contacts page).
