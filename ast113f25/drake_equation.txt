There are ~10^12 galaxies out there, each with !10^11 solar masses worth of
stars. So in total about 10^23 stars inside our visible universe. 

Google the  Drake Equation: it now depends on the lifetime of a civilization
after they invent (radio) telescopes (by which they are thought to communicate)
on whether any other civilizations can ever been detected or communicated with.

If civilizations are unwise enough to destroy themselves within say 100-200 years
after they invent large telescopes, they may never see each other. They may be
like fireflies in the night ... For a real calculation, see:

N = R x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x L.

If I use a realistic: R=1.0 star born/yr, fp=0.8, Ne=0.01, Fl=0.5, Fi=1, Fc=1, 
L=100 yrs, then I get 0.4 civilization in the Milky Way. Just us!
