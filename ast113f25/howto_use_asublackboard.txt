Subject: How to set up Blackboard for AST 113

You will need to request a blackboard site for your sections.

Go to my.asu.edu

Click on "Switch to: Faculty Info"

Under "My Classes" is listed your sections you will be TAing (Becky just
updated this for all those who are switching around)

Click on the "Bb +" icon to the right of your section number

You will see a new page pop up - Click "Continue to Next Step" (do not add
additional sections)

Course name page (don't need to change this from default) Click "Continue"

Select "Start from Scratch"  and click "Continue to Next Step"

On the Assign Roles page, Add yourself as Instructor (Very Important!), and
delete Rogier (so he won't get any emails you send)

(click "Continue")

Summary Page (you should be the only Instructor)  Click "Continue"

Second Summary Page  Click "Confirm Course Request"

Repeat for all Sections!

You will get a confirmation email when your class has been created on
Blackboard.  (it will take a day or two)

Thanks,

Karen

Hello everyone, Just for clarity, access to your lab section requires two
requests: 

1st and for most, you must request access to blackboard on your own.  If you
have already taught you should have access to the faculty tab in MYASU.  Go
there and click on the link for Request Blackboard access.  You will need to
know your section numbers to do this.  

If you do not have a faculty tab, you need to check with HR because this is part
of the hiring process.  Once you have submitted the request for blackboard
access they will notify you, usually within 24 hrs, that it has been granted. 

You can then get into your account through the blackboard link on MYASU it will
still NOT appear in your faculty tab yet.  Your section will appear as a
class.  

Once you are in you can post announcements and email students so everyone will
quit emailing Rogier. 2nd a request for your lab section to show up in MYASU
must be submitted to PeopleSoft.  This has already been done by Rebecca
Polley.  We are all in the process of being approved.  To see the steps for
approval go to this link:

http://help.asu.edu/sims/selfhelp/SelfhelpKbView.seam;jsessionid=26D029416B6C769BBFDE934EC91636FC.node2?parature_id=8373-8193-4476&source=Selfhelp&cid=3704
 It is a short 1 minute video.  Once you've seen it you will understand what is
taking so long.  Our requests have been sent but need security approval, once
granted access will magically show up in MYASU.  If it doesn't you need to check
on your request with PeopleSoft.  You may be lacking some training and haven't
received your clearance.  

There is information on all of this on the link above if you need it. If you are
stuck and need help just email me and I can try to help you troubleshoot. I hope
this helps.  It only took 4 semesters for me to finally understand the whole
process. Eric

have nothing to do with Blackboard.  I believe you can request your own
sites via MyASU.
