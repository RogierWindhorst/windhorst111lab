These are zip files of pre-labs that you can load to your blackboard account.
Under Course Tools select Tests, surveys, and pools. Select Test. Select Import
Test and attach one of the zip files.

To deploy Pre-lab, select on Content it is one of the choices in the left-hand
panel in red. Under Assessments select Test. The pre-lab should show up under
add an existing test. Select the pre-lab and hit submit.

You can then set-up details about the test. Look over them and set them up how
you choose.

I make the pre-lab available a week before the lab. I set the Due date to an
hour before the class.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Teresa
