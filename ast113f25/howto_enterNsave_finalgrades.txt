ALL TA's: Note for future: NOT all grades you entered were in fact saved.

Next time please do as following on: https://www.asu.edu/go/facultycenter/

1) Enter your final grades, and double check them. Correct any if needed.

2) Chance ``Not reviewed'' to: ``Complete'' at the top of the table.

3) Click at the bottom of the table on ``Save''

4) Click at the bottom of the table on ``Post''.

If you forget either one of the last two steps, you need to re-enter all grades!

Thanks!
