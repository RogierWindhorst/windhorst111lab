Subject: PSH461 iMac notes

I installed a boot loader on the PSH461 computers, in an attempt to make it
easier to choose between Mac OS and Windows. Now, when you restart the computer
you'll be given a menu. There's no need to press/hold the ``option'' key.

The boot loader incorrectly detected an OS-reserved Windows partition as
bootable, so you'll see two Windows launchers. The launcher on the right won't
work. Always choose the Windows launcher on the left. If the right-hand one is
chosen you'll see a message that reads ``no boot device --- please insert
disk'' or something to that effect, and the computer will need to be powered
off and restarted. I didn't have time to fix that for next week but I can fix
it in the next couple of weeks if it becomes a problem.

Also, two or three of the iMacs don't seem to immediately find the mouse and
keyboard during startup, so if the boot loader launches but you can't choose
the OS, unplug the keyboard and plug it back in. So far, that has forced the
affected computers to recognize the keyboard. I plan to sort that out in the
next couple of weeks as well. Let me know if it becomes a major problem.

If for whatever reason an instructor or TA needs admin permissions on these
computers, there's an admin account on both sides called ``psh461-admin''. The
password is 8yC4A3HL

Other notes:

SES330 --- The image I installed today contains the LabVIEW fixes that the NI
engineer implemented. I noticed that while Windows is still loading, sometimes
the ``ELVISmx Instrument Launcher'' won't start automatically when the
instrument is plugged in. It can take a couple of minutes for Windows to load
after logging in.

GLG362 --- The geomorphology data has been updated

Let me know if anyone has questions/comments.
