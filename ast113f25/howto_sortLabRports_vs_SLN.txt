Receiving PDF Lab reports via your section's Canvas page is the preferred and 
simplest way to get all weekly Lab reports in. As a backup, we do have the 
option to collect all lab reports into one Gmail account: 

Username: ast113labreports@gmail.com

Pwd for TAs only!:  ast113labreports_forTAs

This file contains a brief write up how to route the Emails from each student into
the appropriate different SLN folders in the Gmail account, so that the TAs only
have to look at the Lab Reports that came in by Email in their respective SLN
folders. For this to work, students must EMail their Lab Reports strictly
following the instructions on the red COVID19 button: 

1) Email all Lab Report PDF files to: ast113labreports@gmail.com by the posted
deadlines. For each Lab Report, use exclusively unique file names that MUST start
with your section's SLN and include your name + submission date and time, e.g.: 

72048_Firstname_Lastname_introsky_31aug20_1030pm.pdf or
72048_Mary_Doe_introsky_31aug20_1030pm.pdf . 

Never include empty spaces in any file name, but use _ (underscores) instead. You
MUST also include your section's SLN as first item into the Email Subject
heading, e.g,:

Subj: 72048 Mary Doe Introsky Lab report, 31 Aug, 2020

Gmail will sort over 360 incoming lab reports automatically each week into
different folders for each appropriate TA. Hence, failure to include your SLN as
*FIRST* item in the Email Subject heading WILL result in your Lab report getting
lost. You can find your correct SLN on your myasu.edu, or at the top of the
Schedule page.
