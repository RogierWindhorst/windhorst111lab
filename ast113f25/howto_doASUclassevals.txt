Subject: Accessing Course Evaluations

Hi everyone,

Here's how you access course evaluations:

1. Go to your MyASU -> Faculty tab

2. Click on Course evaluations under Teaching and Student Support Tools

3. On the new webpage, go to "Reports -> Evaluation Reports"

4. Select the year that you want to review course evaluations from

5. Check the boxes for the courses you want to see evaluations from in the

"Include" column

6. Click on View. A new webpage will be opened with the course evaluations
from whichever course you checked

Best,

Justin
