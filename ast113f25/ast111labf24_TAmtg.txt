Dear AST 111 Lab TAs:

Welcome to the in-person AST 111 Labs for fall 2024. After consulting with all
of you, and after taking into account as much as possible everyone's
preferences, we have now a working version of the class website:

http://windhorst111lab.asu.edu/

By replying ONLY to me, please tell ASAP me the following:

1) Confirm that the following slot works for your for our weekly TA-meeting: 

REGULAR: Tues 12 noon-1:30 pm (we'll stick to 1 hr). First mtg Tu Aug. 20.

ONCE A MONTH: Mo 5:30-6:30 pm (due to a Tu class conflict). Happens Mo Aug. 26.

2) Contacts page: Your preferred Email address, your 1-hr/week office hour time
slot, and your Zoom link if you want to hold your office hour by Zoom.

3) Schedule page: Please confirm with me the listed days of the week that you
are scheduled to teach your sections. Please refer to the Email Becky sent with
the number of section you are asked to teach. (We are aware that some of you
are slated for only 25% (10 hrs/week) as TA for AST 111 given other TA duties).

Please respond by Fr. Aug. 16, so I may finalize this website before our first
TA mtg next week. 

I always try very hard to make sure that no students work more than 20 hrs/wk
on their TA job (or less if you are scheduled for part time TA work), and
usually much less. The earlier I get all your answers, the better I can 
accommodate your requests. 

Looking fwd to see you all Tuesday Aug. 20, 12 noon in PSH-461.

You can always call my cell if you want to discuss some details. 

Thank you all!

Rogier 480-540-0816
