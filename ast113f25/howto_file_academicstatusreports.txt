Subject: Re: Academic Status Report, Session C (fwd)

The Academic Report system is now working.

To access the academic reports go to the faculty section of myasu and follow: In the My Classes box, click
the “Class Tools” icon and select “Academic Status Report” from
the list.

A status report does not need to be entered for all students--only those who are performing at the D, E or
Unsatisfactory level.

I personally only entered grades for students who are failing, have a D or close to it. I recommend putting
down why the student is failing, there are options like low quiz scores, no class attendance.

I did post midterm grades on blackboard for all my students. So if you haven't told your students what their
grade is currently, you can use the Status Report to do that.

If you have any questions about the Reports, email me and Michael.

Best,
Teresa
