AST 111 Labs - Syllabus and Course Rules - Fall 2025

</B></font></font></font></h2>

<P> <font color="#000000">

<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"> Please stand by for last minute
notices on changes to the class rules and schedule as required by ASU. 
(Click on COVID-19 rules in case pandemic flares up again). All AST 111 Labs 
in Fall 2025 will be in person. 
</font></b><font color="#000000">

<P>

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Course Objectives: </b> Acquire a good overall 
understanding of what the night sky and astronomical data tell us about the 
Solar System and its origin.
 
<p><b><font face="Arial"> Expected Learning Outcomes: </b>
 
<p> Goal 1: Make or review observations of celestial objects using the naked 
eye and astronomical tools.

<p> Goal 2: Analyze these data qualitatively and quantitatively to explain 
and predict astronomical phenomena.

<p> Goal 3: Apply the laws of physics to explain the motions and physical 
properties of solar system objects.

<p> Goal 4: Study some physical properties of exoplanets when compared to 
solar system objects.

<p> Goal 5: Analyze the data to derive the properties and implied evolution 
of solar system objects.

<p> Goal 6: Learn to formulate hypotheses in astronomy using evidence 
from qualitative or quantitative sources. 

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Credits and Pre-requisites: </b> The AST 111 Labs or
AST 112 Labs are one credit-hour laboratory class associated with the AST 111 
or 112 lecture classes. Every student wishing to take the AST 111 or 112 Labs
must be currently enrolled in a AST 111 or 112 Lecture, or have previously
taken either one of those lecture courses. Knowledge of the lecture course
material is assumed in the AST 111/112 Lab curriculum and in the Lab exercises.

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Policy on Overrides for the AST 111 or 112 Labs: </b>
There are currently still a few AST 111 Lab sections open, so please sign up for
those if you need to get into the Lab. Overrides will NOT be given, because
the class rooms would get overfull. No exceptions. Instructor signature is no
longer required for course withdrawal. If you need help withdrawing from the
course, contact Mrs. Becca Dial (see Contacts page).

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000">

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Policy on switching AST 111 or 112 Lab sections: </b>
Since 450-550 students take the AST 111 or 112 Labs and nearly all sections are
full at the start of the semester (some are already overfull because of
overrides given to graduating seniors), we do NOT allow students to change AST
111 or 112 Lab sections. That is, changing to or attending a different section
with a different TA on a different night is NOT allowed. 

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Attendance: </b> Laboratory classes require
participation. Students are expected to attend all scheduled class periods.
Missing three labs/lab reports (as recorded by attendance or by missing lab
scores) will result automatically in a grade of "E". Because we drop the lowest
lab score in the calculation of the final grade, NO make-up labs will be
scheduled, except in documented cases of extreme hardship (see Absences below).
A documented excuse for a missed Lab doesn't prevent you from having to make-up
that Lab. </b>Please contact your TA if you must miss a lab.</font> 

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Policy on Absences, missed Labs or make-up Labs: </b>
The Labs will meet and do indoor exercises on the days of inclement
weather. In the event of serious illness or death in the family that students
can document in writing to their TA, or other exceptional cases approved by
your TA or instructor, students may attend a missed Lab when it is taught
during another night that week or the weeks thereafter (check the Schedule
button). You must ask the other TA to Email your grade for that missed section
to the TA of your own section. [Failure to do the latter will likely result in
the grade for that one made-up Lab getting lost in the end].

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Lab Fee: </b> The AST 111 and 112 Labs no
longer have separate Lab fees. As per Arizona Board of Regents' regulations,
Lab fees are included in your tuition. In particular, these are used amongst
others to support upgrading the AST 111 or 112 Labs materials, including new
telescopes and other equipment, new computer Labs and AST software upgrades, as
well as overhead projectors. This assures that we can teach the AST Labs more
efficiently to more students this semester and in the future.

<p> Every semester we try to keep your cost as low as possible. All of the Lab
scripts are free (see Lab Scripts and Schedule buttons). You only need a few
additional items for this Lab: 

<p> 

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial">Edmund Scientific's Rotating Star & Planet Locator 
or ``Starwheel'', with Instruction Manual (about $ 12.75)</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial">Constellation Chart-Equatorial (about $
2.25) --- get the star charts with labels</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial">Constellation Chart-North Polar Region (about
$ 2.25) --- get the star charts with labels</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial">OPTIONAL: ISBN 0-679-40852-5: National Audubon Society 
``Field Guide to the Night Sky'' (1991, Chanticleer Press); $ 10.40-26.00 for
"rent-used" to "buy-new") </font></li>

<p> You need to buy the first three items, your TA will tell you if you need to
buy the Field Guide --- most likely, this can be shared between students. In
the AST Labs, students work typically in small teams of 2-3 students each.

</li></ul>

<p><font face="Arial"> Additional materials will be necessary throughout the
semester that we will not be providing - make sure you have these available to
you (also available in the bookstore or elsewhere): </font>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial"> A working low-powered flashlight, preferably with a red
lens or filter to help you preserve night vision. Red-light pen flashlights
(Rothco G.I. Type D-Cell Flashlight; Item: Pt528) are available for about $
15.00 in the Supply section of the ASU bookstore. They can also be bought at
Home Depot or online. If all else fails, display this red image on your PDA to
create red light: <a

(open in a new tab).

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial"> A scientific calculator. </font> NOTE: It is allowed
to use cell-phones as calculators for this Lab (hold your phone in horizontal
mode to get the expanded scientific calculator mode). 

</li></ul>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Lab Exercises, Lab Reports and Pre-Labs: </b>

<p> Each student is expected to complete the lab report during the class
period that the exercise is performed. 

<p> Each student's work is assumed and required to be their own. NO GROUP LAB
REPORTS WILL BE ACCEPTED! Any cases of plagiarism will be met with a penalty,
and possible assignment of a failing grade for the course. 

<p> Each lab section has a different schedule. Make sure you know your
schedule! Your class time will not change, but the location where the class
will be meeting can change from time to time - so know where you are going to
be meeting. Click on Schedule or ask your TA when in doubt.

The scripts for each night's lab exercise are posted as printable PDF files.
Click on Schedule, and then on each Lab of your section, which displays the
Lab's PDF file that you need to print the night before each Lab starts. <font
color="#FF0000"><b> It is your responsibility to download and print out the lab
scripts the night BEFORE each Lab exercise.</b> </font><font color="#000000">
All computers in public areas on campus are equipped to read and print PDF
documents, so you should be able to download and print the Lab scripts. If you
do experience difficulty, contact your TA ASAP. 

<p>

<b>Due Dates:</b> &nbsp; Pre-labs are due at the beginning of class the night
of the Lab to be performed. The Lab reports and post lab Quiz are due 48 hours
after the Lab class ends (Th Labs are due the next Mo 11:59 pm). No late labs
will be accepted. 

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Academic integrity -- Cheating and Plagiarism: </b> 
Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, and
laboratory work, academic transactions and records. The possible sanctions
include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties, course failure
(indicated on the transcript as a grade of E), course failure due to academic
dishonesty (indicated on the transcript as a grade of XE), loss of
registration privileges, disqualification and dismissal. For more information,
see
<a href="
http://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity
">
http://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity
</a>. 

<p> In the AST Labs we strictly enforce these policies. For your grade, we only
want to measure your abilities, not how well you can copy material from
somewhere else. That is, while you may have 1-2 Lab team mates that together
collect, e.g., telescope data, you still need to write your own Lab report and
answer its questions independently. While you may have Lab data in common with
your team mates, you may not copy answers to questions from your team mates. A
relatively new ASU sanction for documented, serious cases of plagiarism or
academic dishonesty is the grade of XE. This grade will appear on students'
transcripts. A postscript indicates that the grade denotes ``failure due to
academic dishonesty.''

<p><b><font face="Arial">Grades, see: </b> 
<a href="
http://students.asu.edu/student-records-grades
">
http://students.asu.edu/student-records-grades
</a>

<p><font face="Arial"> <font color="#000000">

Course grades are in proportion to the actual amount of preparation, work, 
and studying done for each aspect of the Labs, as following: 

<ul>

<li> <font face="Arial">1-page Pre-Labs, that prepare you for current's week
Lab exercise (20%)</font></li>

<li> <font face="Arial">Short weekly Lab reports, with observations, brief
analysis and discussion (50%)</font>

<li> <font face="Arial">Weekly short quizzes (multiple choice or short
answer), based on previous week's Lab work (30%)</font></li>

</li> </ul>

The final grade for the class will be calculated based on a simple sum of all
of your numerical scores during the semester.&nbsp; <b>The lowest two lab scores
will be dropped.</b>&nbsp; There will therefore be NO make-up Labs in general,
except in documented cases of extreme hardship (see missed labs above). If you
need to miss one Lab, that will be the one you drop. The final letter grade may
be curved to allow for differences in grading between TA's. The typical grade
distribution is indicated by the Table below, but please check with your TA for
the likely curve that will apply to your section. Final grades will include +/-
grades, so please don't ask about these --- they will appear automatically in
the final semester grade if you deserved them based on your work:

</font> <br> &nbsp; <table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="30%" > <tr> 
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">% of points possible</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial"> Stated simply, your grade will be directly proportional
to the number of lab exercises you attend, write-up and hand in. You are
expected to attend all class times your section is scheduled to meet. A+ grades
require extra effort as defined by your TA. 

<p> To simplify the grading system --- and to allow you to get your grades back
earlier! --- at the TA's discretion some or all of each Lab's questions may be
grades on a pass/half/fail system, i.e. each question may simply get 10/5/0
points, depending on how well it was answered as judged by your TA. Most
students in this Lab end up with A's or B's, but you do have to work for
these. Students that don't put in the required work get C's or D's, and
students that fail or cheat end up with E's or EX. </font>

<p> Continuing in Fall 2025, all AST 111 Lab students will also take the AST 111
Lectures, and vice versa (see the ASU class web page for who teaches those AST
111 Lecture classes this semester: <a href="https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/">
https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/</a> ). You will earn your AST 111 Lab and AST
111 Lecture grades separately, but they will be combined into one AST 111 grade
on your transcript. Because the AST 111 Lecture is worth 3 SCH and the Lab 1
SCH, your numerical AST 111 Lab percentage grades above will be combined with
your AST 111 Lecture grades using a 25%/75% weighting to determine your final
AST 111 letter grade. Your AST 111 Lecture professor will submit these combined
AST 111 letter grades by the December deadline. 

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Grade Appeals: </b> Grade disputes must first be
addressed by discussing the situation with your TA or the Lab instructor. If
the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student may appeal to the
department chair or director per the University Policy for Student Appeal
Procedures on Grades:

allowed, but not to exchange answers to questions with other students.

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Policy against threatening behavior: </b> 
All incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU
student (whether on-or off campus) must be reported to the ASU Police
Department (ASU PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students. If either office
determines that the behavior poses or has posed a serious threat to personal
safety or to the welfare of the campus, the student will not be permitted to
return to campus or reside in any ASU residence hall until an appropriate
threat assessment has been completed and, if necessary, conditions for return
are imposed. ASU PD, the Office of the Dean of Students, and other appropriate
offices will coordinate the assessment in light of the relevant circumstances.

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Reporting Title IX violations: </b> Title IX is a
federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from
participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy
make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An
individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed
on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic
support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on
the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Policy on Sexual Discrimination: </b> Arizona State
University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination,
harassment, or retaliation for the entire university community, including all
students, faculty members, staff employees, and guests. ASU expressly prohibits
discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by employees, students,
contractors, or agents of the university based on any protected status: race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual
orientation, gender identity, and genetic information. 

<p>

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Course Evaluation </b> Students are expected
to complete the course evaluation. The feedback provides valuable information
to the instructor and the college and is used to improve student learning.
Students are notified when the online evaluation form is available.

<p><b><font face="Arial"> Syllabus Disclaimer </b> The syllabus is a
statement of intent and serves as an implicit agreement between the instructor
and the student. Every effort will be made to avoid changing the course
schedule but the possibility exists that unforeseen events will make syllabus
changes necessary. Please remember to check your ASU email and the course site
often.

<p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Lab and Telescope Equipment and Care: </b> 

<p>

<p> Please be careful with all AST Lab equipment (your state tax and tuition 
dollars at work)! In particular, always:

<p>(1) During the pandemic, use the available isopropyl alcohol-based cleaning 
materials and tissues to clean telescope eye-pieces and all touched surfaces as
needed, and use frequent hand sanitizer;

<p>(2) If needed, please ask your TA to remove dust from the telescope's main 
corrector lens in front with a gentle cloth or brush. NEVER touch or scratch 
the telescope optics --- they are very delicate and expensive!;

<p>(3) Place the black dust covers back onto the front of the telescopes when 
done;

<p>(4) At the end of the night, return all eyepieces, binoculars, flashlights, 
and any other materials that your TA loans out to you at the start of the 
night. Your TA will put them back in storage; 

<p>(5) The TA will ask you to hold your driver's license or ASU ID for the
evening, if you must borrow something of value like a Lab laptop or binoculars. 
Your ID will be returned to you at the end of the night, when you return all
these materials (please remind your TA!).

<p>Please help us keep the Lab costs down by returning all borrowed Lab 
materials at the end of the night. Thank you!
