How to submit your AST 111 Lab Reports </font></font></h3>

<P> <font color="#000000">

Always write your Lab Reports on single sided printed pages with your name +
ASU-ID number and submission date/time written on top. If you met with your TA
in person at ASU, you can hand in your Lab report in person at the end of the
night. Otherwise, please scan each Lab Report into a single PDF file. You can
use any ASU library printer to scan and Email the PDF to you, or you can make
a single PDF from your Lab Report pages that you scan at home with the
following app on your PDA: 
<a href="
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner&hl=en_US
">

</a>

<font color="#000000"><font size="+0">

<P> 

Unless you could hand-in your Lab Report to your TA in person at ASU, please 
submit your Lab reports as following:

<P> 

1) In Canvas, click on Assignments, scroll down to select  the Lab module of
that week, click Start to do the Prelabs and Quizzes, and  then perform the
final upload of your PDF file of the actual Lab Report. Due  to the many
time-zones of all AST 111 Lab students, all deadlines will have  a 24 hr grace
period. 

<P> 

2) Please do NOT Email your Lab reports PDF files to the TAs or Instructor Email
addresses, since they will also get lost. File formats other than PDF will not
be accepted. Any good Doc file can be simply converted to PDF. If you have a
hard time scanning all you Lab Report pages into a single  PDF file, please
check out: 
<a href="
https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/ 
">
this free toolkit to concatenate single-page PDF scans into one PDF file. 
</a> If you cannot produce a PDF file, please contact your TA.

ASU guidelines during and after the COVID19 pandemic </font></font></h3>

<P> <font color="#000000">

COVID-19 campus plans and resources. As the fall 2024 semester begins, we
appreciate your continued efforts to help keep the ASU community safe and
healthy.

<P>

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance note that
vaccination and boosters significantly reduce the risk of severe illness or
death from COVID-19.

<P>

We encourage you to remember these essential COVID-19 prevention tips:

<P>

* COVID-19 is spread person-to-person or by touching contaminated surfaces.
Asymptomatic individuals can spread the disease.

<P>

* Wash your hands frequently and use hand sanitizer when necessary. Clean 
surfaces with disinfectant.

<P>

* Employees who test positive or show symptoms of the virus should stay home
and notify their supervisor.

<P>

* COVID-19 tests are available free of charge. Testing is a critical way to
limit viral spread. COVID-19 tests are available on all ASU campuses for
students, employees and dependents through 
<a href="

">
Devils' drop-off
</a>.

<P>

* COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters are readily available. Follow the
evolving guidance for boosters, particularly those in more vulnerable age groups
and those with other conditions that may increase risk. Learn more about
COVID-19 vaccines on the

areas that are not required. We ask that you respect others' personal
decisions regarding face coverings.

Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and will revise protocols as necessary.
