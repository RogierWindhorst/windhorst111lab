AST 111 Labs - Lab Scripts for Fall 2024

</b></font></font></font></h2>

<p>

<b><font color="FF0000"> BEFORE YOU COME TO CLASS EACH WEEK:

<p> Print the Pre-Lab Exercises and Lab Scripts the night before you come to 
class, and bring them to class (DON'T print them all at the start of the
semester, since some Labs may get updated a few days before they start,
especially if weather requires). The Labs are listed below by subject matter.
This is NOT the order in which you will be doing these exercises. Make sure you
know which exercise your section will do each week: Click on Schedule and
follow your TA's instructions! [The correct Lab Scripts are also listed as
colored links under the Schedule button for each date that your section meets.]

<p><font size=+0 face="Arial, Helvetica"> Note that not <b>all</b> of the
scripts listed below will be used. Some are backup Labs that may be used if bad
weather or other reasons prevent the use of a regularly scheduled Lab. Check
the schedule for the actual ones to print, and when in doubt, follow your TA's
Email instructions or ask your TA.

<p><font size=+0 face="Arial, Helvetica"> Unless otherwise indicated, for each 
Lab there is a Prelab, which may be included as the first page of each Lab's PDF
file below, or will be posted via Canvas. For each Lab, print and read the
whole PDF document, AND fill out the Prelab BEFORE you come to class that
night. This gets you well prepared for that Lab, and will help you to use your
time more effectively each night.

</a>] to determine what elements the spectra correspond to. 
</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <u>Orbital Motion</u> - This
exercise investigates Kepler's Law of Motion and uses a planetarium program to
observe the motion of the planets to re-derive Kepler's Third Law. <b>Also
bring two sheets of graph paper</b>. [<a href="orbital.pdf">Lab Script</a>]
(1.4 Mb). [<a href="orbital_resultsempty.xls">Empty Orbital Spreadsheet (37 kb)

Lab Script</a>], while a full 180-pg. manual is available 
[<a href="Starry_Night_Pro_5_Manual.pdf"> here as Starry_Night_Pro_5_Manual.pdf 
</a>]. 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Galaxy Morphology </u> - In this
lab, you will be using images of galaxies to learn how to assign Hubble
classifications based on the appearance of the galaxies. This exercise comes with
a fabulous webtool that lets you zoom into the Hubble UltraDeep Field at
hyperspeed (over 10^12 times the speed of light --- theoretically!), so that you
can make the journey to the edge of the universe in a few minutes instead of in
13 billion years: [<a href=" http://ahah.asu.edu/index.html ">
http://ahah.asu.edu/index.html </a>]. The repository of galaxy images we will use
for this lab are on: <a href=" http://windhorst111lab.asu.edu/galmorph.html ">
http://windhorst111lab.asu.edu/galmorph.html </a>. Just click on each JPG image to
enlarge it. Your TA will tell you which version of the Galaxy Morphology Lab to
use: [<a href="galmorph.pdf">Galaxy Morphology without AHaH </a>] (195 kb); or

[<a href="galmorph_comb_f20.pdf ">Galaxy Morphology combined with AHaH </a>] (214
kb). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Hubble Expansion Lab</u> - In
this Lab, you will learn how Edwin Hubble about the expanding universe, and how
the Hubble Space Telescope --- named after him and launched over 60 years later
--- has revolutionized astronomy and given us images of the farthest reaches of
the universe, almost 13 billion light-years away from us --- so the light emitted
by those most distant objects took 13 billion years to reach us. This exercise
will also use the AHaH webtool: [<a href=" http://ahah.asu.edu/index.html ">
http://ahah.asu.edu/index.html </a>]. Your TA will tell you if you will be using
the [<a href="hubble_AHaH.pdf">latest Hubble Expansion Lab script </a>] (349 kb).
Or, if your TA tells you, use a simpler version of the [<a
href="hubble.pdf">older computer-based Hubble Expansion Lab</a>]. Both use this
webtool plus its [<a href="hubble_spreadsheet.xls">Hubble Lab spreadsheet</a>]
(370 kb). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <u>Motion of the Night Sky</u> -
this lab focuses on how the Night Sky moves, and why. You will need your North
and South sky sketches from the other two Naked Eye labs to complete this
exercise. [<a href="motion.pdf">New Lab Script</a>] (740 Kb); ([<a
href="motion_f09.pdf">Old non-computer Lab Script</a>]) (970 Kb). 
For this Lab, you will need a protractor to measure angles, which can be 
found by Googling for Protractor Apps, e.g,:

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKUP LAB: <u>Archeoastronomy</u> 
- This lab uses the Planetarium features in Starry Night Pro to allow you to 
simulate sunrise, sunset, and other astronomical events at various ancient
sites. These structures are thought to have been built to mark celestial
events - you will judge the evidence yourself. [<a href="archeo.pdf">Lab
Script</a>] (301 Kb)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">BACKUP LAB: <u>Supermassive Black Hole Lab</u>
- In this Lab, you will learn about one of the deepest mysteries of the
universe: much less than 1% of the baryonic mass of the universe (or less than
0.03% of its total energy density) managed to end up in supermassive black
holes, from which even objects traveling at the speed of light (such as the
photons or light we see) cannot escape. Yes, this very tiny fraction of mass in
supermassive black holes surrounds itself with super-bright accretion disks
that can outshine all of the stars other galaxies in the universe at all
wavelengths, resulting in quasars and radio galaxies that are so bright that
they are visible to the very edge of the universe:
[<a href="agnlab.short.pdf"> Black Hole Lab (Short version 0.5 Mb)</a>];

[<a href="agnlab.long_s18.pdf"> Black Hole Lab (Long version with more space 
for your answers; 1.5 Mb)</a>],
This exercise comes with a fabulous webtool that lets you fall into a
Supermassive Black Hole, to give you an idea what it is to deal with infinite
gravity, and how the monsters inside active galactic nuclei feed themselves:

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <u>Planetary Atmospheres</u> -
what if you changed the strength of the Sun, what if you changed the thickness
of our atmosphere? What would be the effect of these changes? You will learn a
lot more about how Planetary Atmospheres work and the truth versus fiction
about the greenhouse effect. [<a href="atmos.pdf">Lab Script</a>] (17.4
Kb)</font></font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKUP LAB: <u>Launching to
Orbit</u> - What does it take to launch a rocket of a given mass to low-Earth
orbit. How much velocity is needed, how much energy and how much fuel? But you
need to launch most of the fuel as well --- at least the part that you don't
burn before liftoff --- so what does it really take? This Lab will go into
those details. [<a href="launchingtoorbit.pdf">Lab Script</a>] (300
Kb)</font></font>
