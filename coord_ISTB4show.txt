Hi All:

For our AST 113 Coordinate Systems Lab Tuesday Sept 29-Monday Oct. 5, all
sections will meet at their regular class time via their regular Zoom links (see
Schedule page on windhorst113.asu.edu). 

During this time, all sections will SWITCH from 8:30-9:15 MST to a different Zoom
link to see the closely related ISTB$ Marston show of the rotating night sky, the
solar system and the universe. 

For those nights only, to attend that show on Sept 29-Monday Oct. 5, from
8:30-9:15 pm MST you will all need to switch to the following Zoom link:

https://asu.zoom.us/j/7907556285

Then before and after that show, you will attend attend (by switching back again 
to) your regular Zoom link.

Thank you all very much!

Rogier Windhorst
