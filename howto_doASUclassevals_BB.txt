Subject: Evals step-by-step

TAs,

Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to set up the evals.

1) Download the file I sent you on the previous email. The file is a  
zipped file. DO NOT UNZIP THE FILE.

2) Rename the part of the file name that has the section number.  
Replace it with the section number of one of your sections.

3) Go to the blackboard (hereafter BB) page of the section you chose  
(the one you changed the name of the zipped file with).

4) On the lower left part of the BB page click on Course Tools (under  
the Course Management menu).

5) Click on Tests, Surveys and Pools.

6) Click on Surveys.

7) Click on Import Surveys.

8) Click on Browse for Local File.

9) Select the renamed zip file.

10) Click Submit and wait for a WHILE. The file is 17 Mb so it will  
take a while.

11) Once it uploads click ok.

12) Next to the name of the file there is a button with 2 arrows that  
point down. Click on it and click Edit.

13) Next to the word Header there is a button with 2 arrows that point  
down. Click on it and click Edit.

14) OPTIONAL: If you don't want to give your students 10 extra credit  
points for completing it delete that sentence. I delete it because I  
feel it is a little of an ethical problem giving students pts for  
evaluations.

15) Click on Submit.

16) Now on the top left of the BB page there is a red box with the  
different sections of the page. Above it there is a  button with a +  
sign. It is a maroon square and the + sign is white. Move your mouse  
to it and click on Create Content Area.

17) Name it Course Evaluations and DO NOT FORGET to select the box  
that says Available to Users. Click Submit.

18) Go to that Content Area you just created.

19) Move your mouse to the button called Evaluate and click on Create  
Survey.

20) Select the name of the zipped file you uploaded earlier from the  
Add Survey box and click Submit.

21) OPTIONAL: Change the name of the file to remove the underscores.

22) THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Under Survey  
Availability there is an option called Make the Link Available. SELECT  
YES. If you don't your students won't see the evaluations.

23) Under Survey Availability there is an option called Add a New  
Announcement for this Survey. Select yes.

24) OPTIONAL: Change the options to your liking. Just know that the  
surveys should be completed before you give them the grades. You  
should set up a deadline on the Display Until option to Dec. 7th,  
2010. If you make it password protected you need to give the students  
the password. Click Submit.

25) Email your students letting them know how to access the Evals.

26) Go have a good glass of wine, maybe a nice Gew√ºrztraminer or a  
something from Burgundy. You deserve it after doing this for every  
single section. Don't forget to change the name of the file for every  
single section.

27) Drink the rest of the bottle of wine. Well if tomorrow is a school  
day then only drink half. If it is the weekend, bottoms up.
